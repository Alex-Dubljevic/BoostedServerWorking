Over-the-top action and daring cutscenes blend together for a brand new type of action game! Asura was betrayed 
by his fellow gods and stripped of all his powers. Consumed by anger at the injustice he has suffered and 
swearing vengeance, Asura discovers he can use this fury to his advantage and turn it against his enemies.
