Similar to its predecessor, Destiny 2 is a first-person shooter game that incorporates role-playing and 
massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements. The original Destiny includes on-the-fly matchmaking that 
allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were "matched" by the game.
